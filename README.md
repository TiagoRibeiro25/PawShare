## About :bulb:

Paw Share is a compassionate application committed to aiding animals and their caregivers during difficult times. Our app connects individuals facing the challenge of caring for their pets or encountering animals in distress with appropriate solutions to ensure the well-being of these cherished creatures.

We stand firmly against the promotion of animal breeding for profit and instead advocate for responsible adoption and support for animals in distress. At Paw Share, our mission is to foster a culture of empathy and assistance towards animals in need.

Moreover, Paw Share facilitates temporary pet care, enabling pet owners to entrust their beloved companions to the care of others during their absences or times of incapacity. Our primary focus is not financial gain, but rather, it is on cultivating and strengthening the bonds shared by passionate animal lovers like you.
